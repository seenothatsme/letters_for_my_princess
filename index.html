<p>Scratch that, you just told me you bought a lot of things. I love that for you. You deserve all the best things in this life. You're my sweetest, cutest little baby girl. </p>
<p>I really don't know where I would be without you. I love you, so much. I know you are sometimes disappointed in me for not doing much. I am a man of inaction, but you my baby, you make me want to do everything I can to make things special for you. To take care of you, to love you and cherish you, and to let you know how much I love you. </p>
<p>We're coming up on 3 years now of dating each other. Isn't that wild? It feels like a lifetime, but also it feels like we just started. You've changed my life for the better. You make me want to be a better man, for you. You deserve the best, and I feel like I've got a long way to go to be the man you deserve, but I will get there. This ain't a sob story. I will be the man you love, and you'll be with for the rest of your life. </p>
<p>Anyways, this might be a little gay? I don't know. Hope you like this virtual space I got going for you my baby. Love you so much. </p>
<p>I will keep doing this for as long as I can. And I'll keep loving you for much longer. </p>
<p>With all my love</p>

        content: `<p>Hello my dearest little princess!</p>
<p>I am sorry for our little spat last night. I really got upset about the fact that you couldn't spare some time for me. I think I came from a place of being anxious over where you were, and a little bit of feeling like I was abandoned. I know, maybe it was a little intense. I don't expect you to keep texting me while everyone's partying and you're out. I know that's not right. Just, it was a combination of ugly feelings. I am sorry for how I behaved and how I expressed my feelings.</p>
<p>I love you. I wanted last night to be perfect. I poured my heart into making this project happen. It was a lot of back and forth and I only did it because I love you. I thought you'd best appreciate these colours and vibe. Don't they remind you of a nice deep forest-like place? A perfect place for my little baby princess to perch and rest.</p>
<p>I want to remind you again, I love you so much. More than I knew I could love anyone. I wasn't so anxious and dare I say, needy, before this. I'd gotten used to being alone, soothing myself, keeping busy when you weren't around. I don't know if I loved that so much, but it was what it was. With you, I've also blossomed into this person. A more vulnerable, in his feelings man with some needs and wants. I'm sorry to make you feel like crap last night and imposing my negative reactions to your actions on you, even when you weren't ready for it. I was feeling very unsettled.</p>
<p>I'm sorry baby. I love you so so so much my jaana. More than you could ever think.</p>
<p>Always yours, forever and more<br>Samsiedoodie</p>`

<p>I can't believe its just one day to our anniversary. That's crazy, isn't it? I love you so much! Its so hard to say how much I love you because I always fail to quantify it. It scares me, intimidates me. I love you so so so so so so so much.</p>
<p>I've truly and wholly been positively influenced by the girlfriend effect. You have come into my life, and made me a fuller, better man for it. Thank you. For having the patience to deal with this caveman and making me the sweet boy I am today. Before you say it, I know, I know I've got a long way to go to be better. But like, what's the rush, right? I've got a lifetime of learning and growing with you.</p>
<p>Thank you also, for sending me reels that educate me on how to be better with you. The things you sent me today were really impactful. I'll be better in how I show up in difficult situations. I'll be better in taking care of you and your emotions. I'll be gentler and softer, because you are my sweet sweet little baby. I love you so much. You're the sweetest, bestest thing in my life. Showing up for you, and making you happy in our relationship will most likely be the best thing I ever do in my life. It's my life's purpose almost. And I love it. I couldn't ask for anything else.</p>
<p>I am so excited for tomorrow my baby. I love you so much. Here's to more life, more love, more crazy moments, and a whole lotta lovin üòöüòöüòö</p>

<p>I love you so much. Today has been so cute, I can't. I've been a little sleepy however, missed my 6pm mark. But you'll allow me a little leeway, won't you?</p>
<p>HAPPY 3 YEARS ANNIVERSARY BABY! I miss you a lot, but I've been relatively okay. I've been reliving some of our memories, and man, it has been so great having you to share my life with. I cannot wait to form so more memories with you my baby.</p>
<p>I love your new nails so much! They're so much cuter than the last ones, and they suit you so well! I am sad I'm missing out on holding and kissing them, but you can get those done again! Hehe. Maybe next time you could also try a different colour. Maybe a sage green? Or a black? I don't know, you decide.</p>
<p>Have fun tonight baby. May the stars glow extra bright for you today. May they reflect the love I have for you in my heart. You're my heart, you're my light. You're my everything.</p>

<p>I'm sorry about the way I reacted to things today. I miss you, and I love you, and only you.</p>
<p>I hope we can talk to each other about this again over clearer heads. I still feel like you don't listen to me enough and I get put into a high pressure situation where I say things that I don't even want to, or mean to.</p>
<p>I am sorry for hurting you with my mean words today. I hope you can come back and talk to me again, in a better, more considerate way. I've been reflecting on our communication patterns, and I realize I need to do better at expressing my needs without putting pressure on you. When I feel unheard or misunderstood, I sometimes react from a place of frustration rather than love, and that's not okay. The pressure I felt doesn't excuse the hurtful words that came out of my mouth.</p>
<p>I only want you, and I only need you. I'm here whenever you're ready to talk. There's no rush, no pressure - just me, waiting with love and hope that we can move forward together, stronger than before. You are my everything, my jaan. I love you deeply and completely.</p>

<p>I'm so happy for you, for your Goa trip. You've been wanting to go for a trip like this, especially the solo travelling part, and now you're getting it! I'm so excited. I know you'll take care of yourself and all, but still, please don't do anything stupid. Don't go into shady areas and keep your wits by yourself. And come back soon and safe, okay?</p>
<p>I'll be missing you so much. But you have your fun there okay? Don't think too much about me and everything else. We'll all be fine. You have fun, and make precious little memories there. Okay?

<p>What a day, huh? You've gotten such a crazy story you've got for today. I've never known anyone also who's gotten a flight of their redirected to somewhere else. You've been through it now. Haha. How do you feel? If I were you, I'd use this story when we meet our friends. It's a unique experience to have had.</p>
<p>I'm sorry I'm late today. I've had a rollercoaster of a day too. I never imagines to get these tickets and now that I have, I've worked myself into a panic, and I've been feeling drained. Its crazy.</p>
<p>Anyways, I just wanted to tell you that I know you've planned to go to Goa with a daily plan, and I know you, that you'd be upset if things didn't go the way you wanted them to be. I know you, and you can be hard on yourself. Don't feel like you have to maximize each and every day of your time there baby. Don't ride yourself so hard my little baby. I want you to take care of yourself, and stay safe. I guess I'm also anxious about you being there alone, by yourself.</p>

There's no better feeling than when we lock eyes while laying next to each other. Oof. I'm so lucky that I get to pet you as I put you to sleep.

<p>I love you so much my jaana. I hope you get to go and do your thing today, and everyday after.</p>
<p>I've mostly been procrastinating again, but that's also because the timeline on this project got delayed. But still, I should be a little more productive. I'd love me to be more productive and do things. I can't shake all these distractions though. The movies and TV, games everything.</p>
<p>Anyways, I guess I'll figure my way out of it soon enough. Its an uphill battle and you work your way out of it a little by little everyday.</p>
<p>Fuck, now I am late. I swear I am creatively and physically fatigued. I really miss you too.</p>
<p>Tomorrow it's going to be 3 weeks since dad came, 3 more weeks to go.</p>
<p>I hope you're having fun baby. Pray that I get some sense knocked into me.</p>
<p>I love you.</p>
<p>Yours only, your idiot<br>Samsiedoodie</p>`

<p>I love you so much jaana. I miss you like so much you have no idea. Its crazy. But you'll be back in town soon, and I'll get to see more and more of you very soon.</p>
<p>I hope Goa has been nice on you ya. I know there were some bits that you weren't so happy about, but overall, I hope it was a great trip. I want you to have the best in the world, cause that's who you are. Best in the world my jaan.</p>
<p>Work is a little crazy. This gig with Sanam will get intense, and I'm shouldering just about all the aspects for this part of the job. I'll be caught up with this only till the 20th of September. I don't know yet how everything will work out regarding my actual fulltime job, and this gig. I want to come out to see you too, but I don't know how yet. It feels almost like a prison to just be at home. I feel like a fetid dog. Hehe. You'd still love a fetid dog, won't you?</p>
<p>Safe flight for tomorrow baby. Also, its crazy but this is day 15 of these letters ya! How do you like them so far? Let me know okay jaana?</p>
<p>I love you so much my baby.</p>

<p>I love you so much ya, I'm giddy with excitement to come hold you ya jaan. You have no idea what it feels like. Fuck!</p>
<p>I am so in love with you its crazy. I never imagined I'd be so bewitched by anyone, like I am with you. It's like my wellbeing and peace and happiness is so tied with you. I don't care if its unhealthy, I like it, hehe.</p>

<p>I am so sorry I fucked up by not writing this sooner, I messed up. To be honest, I missed the 6pm time because I was taking my depression nap. But that shouldn't be an excuse.</p>
<p>I am sorry again, that I couldn't come to see you today. I really, really, really wanted to. I don't know why my luck is so rotten when it comes to the relationship with my parents. I really just wanted some time of solace with my baby girl, and just be with her and have some fucking peace and quiet. I am so mad about that.</p>
<p>Anyways, I love you my baby. You looked so incredibly good on video call tonight. How are you so hot? How do you get the audacity to look that fucking good ya baby. Its not fair ya.

And you talk about not loving your body? I will love your body for the both of us, don't you worry. I love you so much my little baby. You're a sexy little vixen and I am deeply, deeply attracted to you.</p>
<p>Its crazy how I wasn't going to go to the office today with my parents. That small decision would have led me to not be able to get this work and any of the things that comes with it. Again, I don't want to get too big for my boots, but I am excited. I just wanna meet you tbh and this is a good excuse to be able to spend more time with you.</p>

<p>Meeting you was like a weary old traveller in the peak heat of the desert finally running into an oasis. Just the relief of being with you was like a huge weight was lifted off of my shoulders. Really. You have no idea how good it feels to be able to just be with you. You're so intertwined with my body, my heart, my soul. You are my precious little baby, my little flower. My little angel.

<p>You are my soul, my heart, my peace. Loving you is so easy ya baby. It's the sweetest thing, the thing that brings me the most peace, and maybe its the only thing I want to do in the world. I'm sorry I've been such a dick ya baby. I don't mean to.</p>

<p>Also btw, today too has been such an amazing day my baby. I cannot believe that we got two consecutive days with each other, on our own. I can't thank my lucky stars enough. It just has been so crazy getting this time with you my baby. I was so scared that realistically, we might not get any time to meet while my dad's here. And this has just been so crazy. I really think our love for each other has moved the universe to make it so that these two days were possible. May our love remain so strong that it moves the universe to do what we want to do. After all, we're the strongest things in the whole universe, two lovers, who just love each other. Isn't that crazy?</p>

<p>I'm sorry for our thing. The words I used to describe you and put you down. I am so sorry. I shouln't have reacted like I did, with you. I know I have intense reactions to things I really believe in. Politics is one of the biggest of those things.</p>

<p>I obviously am concerned about the fact that he died the way he did. Yeah he has a family and it is unfortunate, and it is crazy. I've been worried about what the fallout from this assassination would be. But none of that really matters here. I know you have your POV on the whole thing, and I have one too.

<p>I miss you so much. I don't like the fact that you're just gone. I got really mad at your behaviour towards me when I said I'd have to go to the registration thing. I can't say no to things now if I want to come out to see you. So I gotta do what I gotta do ya jaan. Please understand na? There was no need to shout at me like that. </p>

<p>Coming to the more severe thing, I'd like to apologise and take responsibility for my shitty attitude towards you. We should have a proper conversation, that needed more nuance and understanding than I offered. You're right, I should have been more curious. I thought I kept asking you to tell me what you felt. I should have been more grounded, even though you might be ragebaiting me. I'm sorry for the awful name calling and shit talking to did to you. I realize I need to think more about what I think about this whole Charlie Kirk situation too. I am not some crazy person celebrating someone's assassination like this. I don't condone this shit. Shit like this shouldn't happen anywhere, to anyone. </p>

<p>I don't feel good at all. The pace on the Amazon gig is now accelerated, and I haven't gotten one lick of work done. I need to lock in, and get this shit done. I need to make some money. I can't seem to do it knowing you're mad at me. I know, lame excuse. But if it gives you another reason to come back and talk to me, I'll take it. </p>

<p> I know you think my words don't mean anything, and yeah, I can see why you'd say that too. I haven't been the best about these things. I know, I shouldn't have gotten mad again in the evening, or actually in the first place itself. I'm really sorry about all the mean things I said about you, and the personal things I brought up. I don't think I have any excuses. Yeah, I was sad and maybe a little pissed off about how you spoke to me about the leg. But I still shouldn't have spoken to you like that. Especially because the day before also wasn't so good for you, because of whatever happened between you and your parents. </p>

<p> I don't want to lose you. I don't want to feel the way I do when you speak to me how you do, and how I feel when you show up in arguments the way you do either. I am not entirely sure what I should have done to address my problems with your behaviour, but maybe taking some time out to bring these issues up when we're good and nice to each other would have helped? I don't know what it is, but when times are good I forget all the complaints I have with you that go unaddressed. Sometimes it feels like I'm still living life on autopilot, and a really sucky autopilot at that. I know I've got some more growing to do, but I really want to be growing with you. </p>

<p> I hope you can forgive me? I've come to just submit and be with you, and figure this shit out. I know we could solve everything through talking, making space for each other and just remembering that this is an argument, a fight, but it's not you vs me. Its us vs the problem that we're having. I hope you still have some love in your heart left for me? </p>

I hope you just don't hate me so much that you never want to do that ever. I am so afraid of losing you forever. I don't think I'd be able to handle it. </p>

<p> I don't want to lose you ever. I'm so burnt out right now, you have no clue. Again, I know this is no excuse about my behaviour. I know I fucked up and I said horrible things to you. Things that no doubt, would stick. And what's killer is that none of that is true even. When I calmed down I realize its not even true. I was just misguided and angry and just off the leash. I had an invalid crashout.</p>

<p> I don't like it when you keep talking about taking a break when we fight. I'd rather you say all the mean things you can, and we'll fight it out and then figure it out. When you say you want to take a break it just triggers these feelings of unworthiness in me. I know, its not your concern in that moment. I guess it just becomes so overwhelming for you that you'd just want to pause everything. I get it. But you're my little baby na? I"m your sweeet little baby boy. Come na, we'll figure it all out. We'll sit and we'll talk and we'll figure it all out. I don't want to get defensive or anything. I just want you. Come back to me na please? </p>

<p> I loved our time yesterday so much. I live for these community things. I'm so glad I got invited to this thing. I know, I wasn't so social and I did feel more like a stranger at the start of the shindig, but towards the end I was getting to enjoy it more. I miss having a family, and things like this happening. Just going over to people's houses and having a meal, a laugh and a good time. I yearn for these things I guess. More importantly, I loved our auto rides. I am so grateful that I get to be with someone like you, like this. Just getting to hold the prettiest girl in the world all to myself. The rain splashes and the slip and slide. All of that was crazy. No one else I'd do this for. I am so in love with you.   </p>

<p> I just would have hoped that none of this shit after I got home happened. But nevertheless, I am grateful for the time I get to be with you. What they treat me to is their choice, and there's not much I can do about it. I can be grateful for the things that are going well, and look to manifest more of that.  </p>

<p> I'm sorry for not handling myself better earlier today, and then later with the whole initiatives bit. I hear you jaana. I just, today feels like I don't wanna hear criticisms or suggestions or whatever else. I've been feeling so weird and just dissociating from myself. But I know I should have handled it better. I love you so much, okay? Please don't be so mad at me na baby? </p>

<p> I hope you're doing well. I know you must be at the funeral, and I know how much they're not your thing. I hope you're hanging in there. I'm sorry I couldn't have been there with you, but my heart and love and my care goes out to you. Come back home and tell me how you feel. You can be in your little sanctuary in my arms, and tell me all about it, okay?  </p>

<p> I see that you're sending me things on IG telling me how I don't do something. I hear you, but I also have a feeling that I am doing a lot of those things already. I know, I could be doing better too in many aspects. And I'm always learning, and always growing to love you more, better, in a way that you feel it the most. I don't know. I just have a little bit of a sour feeling hearing you say that I don't do any of it. I guess we'll talk more about it later, in person.  </p>

<p> OMG HI BABY! Feels good to get to writing to you again. These last two days have been like heaven. Fuck. I'm missing you so much. Your embrace, your love, everything. Your food. Your looks. The way you take care of me. The way we hid from everyone and create our own sanctuary. I love it all!   </p>

<p> I don't know about you, but the more and more time I spend like this with you alone, the more and more I'm convinced that I do want to spend the rest of my life with you. You know? Like we can do this. We got this. You and me, can do just about anything. I'll take care of you, you take care of me. What else do we need? </p>

<p> Last night was so sweet. I always love the fact that I do get invited to shindigs by your family. I feel so connected and good, you have no idea. It always feels like I'm quenching a thirst I've had for so long. Being around people who like having you there, and just being a part of something nice like that. I know its gay, but eh? </p>

<p> Also, I'm really sorry that I don't know how to deal with your under/overstimulated situations well. But I know that I can be suffocating trying to 'fix' you in situations like this. Like, I can be hounding you when I try to talk and help figure out a solution for your problems. And yes, that's not fair to you. Its not what helps, and just makes the situation worse. I promise I'll be better. I'll meet you where you are, and just be with you. Offer some gentle suggestions and gentler way to work you up, or work you down. I'm sorry baby that I can be so clueless sometimes. I'm also learning all this as we go. But I promise, I'll be better, okay? </p>

<p> I love you so, so much na baby. I really, really dooooüòöüòöüòöüòöüòö </p>

<p> Fuck I'm so sorry. It feels like I've dropped the ball on this whole thing, doesn't it? I'm sorry. I know I shouldn't be too harsh on myself, but like, sometimes its the easiest thing to do. I've lost my mojo ya, and I don't like it. I feel like I'm just forcing myself to run and do things and just be awake by going from one noise to the other. It keeps me awake and moving, but I don't really do much at all. Even when I'm playing a game, it doesn't feel joyous anymore. All the colour in life seems to have zapped away when you're not around ya.  </p>

<p> I could do just about anything with you, and it would seem like its the best thing in the world. Just sitting out your window, next to you, you putting your head on my chest, on my shoulders. It's the loveliest thing I could ask for. Just come to me na. I wish I could just spend every waking and sleeping minute with you. That would be the best thing for me, really. I love you so much. I hope you're having fun out there, and no one's giving you grief ya. Can't wait to hear from you tonight.  </p>

<p> Take care my doll. Don't miss me too much, hmm? I love you so, so much. üòöüòöüòöüòöüòö </p>

<p> I miss you so much my little mermaid baby. I'm so glad you're out there, having fun, living your best life. But I miss you a lot also, hmm? My days are going so plain, so vanilla without my spicy little baby. Come back safe and sound and we'll continue having our good times, hmm? I love you so much my baby  </p>

<p> Also, yeah I gave it some more thought, and you're right, you haven't had a crash-out like you did about your dada that day. Not that intensely. It was a harrowing time, but looking back at it, I love that I could be there to take care of you during it. I love taking care of my sweet, sweet little baby girl. </p>

<p> I don't know how exactly I feel. I really needed you. I don't feel good at all, I feel alone and misunderstood. I did feel kinda pissed last night, and I know that wasn't right. Today I just feel disappointed and rejected. </p>

<p> I have been telling you, I see why you're upset and I probably shouldn't have liked that post, but I swear I didn't even notice the ass and all the problematic things until you really did point them out. And I'd think that's a good thing seeing how I'm not noticing those things, you know? I can understand how you're this upset also, but I'd expect that you'd understand. Idk, I just didn't expect you to abandon me like this. </p>

<p> I've got a fun fact for you. Did you know that I'm literally saved because of the fact that you exist? </p>

<p> Now, before you say it. It's true. It's really, really true. I wouldn't be the person you love so much, and your family accepts so much, if it weren't for you. And you know what, it's even simpler than that actually. I wouldn't be here without you. I wouldn't like to be here without you. I really, really wouldn't. Life is so much bleaker and stupider and not so fun when you're not around my baby. Everything I have is yours. </p>

<p> I loved our cute little phone call too. I'm so glad you're feeling so much better, so much like yourself now. I can't stand it when you're all sad and withdrawn like the way you can be when something so upsetting happens. I don't like it at all. Nothing in the world ain't right if my baby's all sad and all. </p>

<p> I love you so goddamn much ya üòöüòöüòöüòöüòö </p>

<p> I don't know why I was how I was with you today. I feel so incredibly ashamed. I am so sorry. I am sorry I spoke to you how I did, how I couldn't be there with you, how I hurt you so much, made you second guess yourself and feel so shit about yourself. </p>

<p> I don't want to make this about myself, and oh how fucked up I am and all that, so I won't get into that. I know there's a lot to me that could use so much work. And I'm willing and able to put this work in. I want you to know that I'm really sorry. I come to you with my head down, asking for forgiveness and acceptance and love. I need your love. I need your embrace. I don't want to fight, I don't want the shit slinging. I just want to be with you, at peace and love. </p>

<p> I hope you feel better. I don't think this letter or these words might not do so much. I don't know what sort of man I'm becoming. I'm afraid. I'm afraid of myself sometimes. But I know for a fact that I love you, and I want to keep you safe and sound. And loved. I love you ya baby. No matter how hard you might find it to believe. I love you so much. </p>

<p> I wasn't sure if writing this is a good idea or not, but I haven't in a while, and I've got some shit to say.  </p>

<p> I don't know what exactly got you so ticked off that you had to talk to me like that. I told you everything about the situation, and I told you I didn't consider it big. It was a stupid fucking sticker. Then you brought up Anni for some reason. To try and contrast this situation. But the fact of the matter is you haven't done shit about Anni for me. You haven't stopped. You did everything that you'd absolutely hate if I did. And then you said that now see what all you'll do. All of that was absolutely not done.  </p>

<p> I hate the fact that anything at this point can trigger us to break out like this. I hate the fact that I have to put myself second always. That my needs aren't as important. My feelings aren't. It's always what Gillian wants. I don't like it. I don't deserve this. I feel awful about letting this go on for so long. I know you don't respect me. Even yesterday, you didn't. I hate all of this. I don't like how we can be. I don't know about you. Now you'll toh go and have your fun. I hate that. I told you I haven't been having a good day, but all you could talk about is what you wanted. Nothing about me. I hate that. I hate how you can get to me. I hate how you just always just think I'm doing wrong only. Even for the simplest of matters. It's Samir's fault. It's what I feel at home too, and you make me feel the same way when you get like this. You were supposed to be my person. But you care so much about being good to everyone else, even that fuck all bitch Anni. Fuck him. You only feel bad about ignoring his calls and messages? What about literally everyone else? That you ignore for your own gain. That time you don't feel bad? Fuck this ya.  </p>

<p> As always, I have only me to take care of myself in the end. You've deserted me, yet again. </p>

<p>Have fun</p>
